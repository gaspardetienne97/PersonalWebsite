		<p class="p-4 text-lg">
			Hi, I’m Gaspard Michel Etienne, a passionate Full-Stack Software Engineer with over 5 years of
			experience in crafting scalable and efficient web applications. My journey in technology has
			taken me from building complex enterprise solutions to managing cloud infrastructure, and I
			thrive on solving challenging problems with innovative solutions. Currently based in Boston,
			MA, I’m deeply skilled in modern technologies like React, TypeScript, GraphQL, and Node.js.
			I’ve had the privilege of working with top-tier organizations like CoStar Group, where I’ve
			played a crucial role in developing applications that have made significant impacts on
			business outcomes. But my love for technology doesn’t stop when the workday ends. I’m an avid
			learner who enjoys diving into new tech in my spare time, maintaining a homelab where I
			self-host various services (such as this very website) to continually expand my skill set.
			When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest in tech, playing soccer, traveling
			to new destinations, or experimenting in the kitchen. I believe in the power of technology to
			create meaningful change, and I’m always eager to connect with like-minded individuals. Feel
			free to explore my projects, check out my resume, or get in touch if you'd like to
			collaborate. Thanks for stopping by!

		<p class="p-4 text-lg">
			This website is meant as a sort of dumping ground form my personal life. The idea is to have
			one place where I can have all of the projects, pictures, videos, art, music that I would like
			to share with the world in one place.
